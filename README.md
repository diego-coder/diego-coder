## Open Source Contributions

Active contributor to major open-source agent frameworks, including LangChain, LangGraph, and CrewAI. Focused on improving reliability, schema validation, and agent infrastructure in complex distributed systems.

Contributions include:

- Robust parsing of tool calls and structured outputs
- Pydantic v2 compatibility and schema hygiene
- Crash-proofing agents in CI/CD and API environments
- Checkpointing and state tracking for reproducible workflows
- Dependency validation and test coverage for LLM integrations

These contributions reflect my ability to ramp up quickly on large, high-velocity codebases with significant production impact and community scrutiny. I prioritize reproducibility, minimal test cases, and collaborative debugging, often targeting longstanding or intricate issues with cross-cutting implications.
